# EU State Of The Union Speeches - Text Mining analysis
 
This repository contains the work done by Diego Paroli & David Pereiro Pol for the group assignment of the Text Mining course in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The project consists of an analysis of the EU State Of The Union Speeches by applying several text mining techniques. We look at differences across years and presidencies by looking at **word frequency** and using **TF-IDF** to determine the most distinctive words for each year. We perform **sentiment analysis** to compare positivity and negativity across speeches and lastly we apply **topic modelling** techniques to classify the speeches depending on their main theme.
